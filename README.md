# Katana
Katana is the package management tool and interface for SamuraiWTF 5.0+. Specifically Katana is intended to be used by instructors to set up a classroom lab that
will be distributed to their students, or by self-study students to install the tools and targets they desire to use.

_IMPORTANT NOTES:_
* _Katana runs as root. It is intended only to be used in a temporary classroom environment. Don't install it on any network that is important to you._
* _Katana is installed as part of the [SamuraiWTF Distribution](https://github.com/SamuraiWTF/samuraiwtf) and is not intended to be installed or run on a 
non-SamuraiWTF build._


## Using Katana
There are two ways to use Katana:

### Using Katana with the Web User Interface
By default, Katana should be running at `http://katana.wtf` from within your SamuraiWTF environment. Simply visit the Katana URL from any web browser inside the 
environment. From the. GUI you will be able to install, stop, and start any of the Katana-defined tools and targets. Note that an internet connection is required to
install tools and targets.

### Using Katana from the Command Line
From a command line terminal inside your SamuraiWTF environment, simply type katana and the desired arguments. Katana supports the following arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| :------------- | ------------- |
| `list` | List all available modules that are currently supported by Katana. |
| `install <name>` | Install the supplied module by name. |
| `remove <name>` | Remove the supplied module by name. |
| `start <name>` | Start the supplied module, assuming it is startable. |
| `stop <name>` | Stop the supplied module, assuming it is stopable. |
| `status <name>` | Output the status of the supplied module. This will include whether or not it is installed and if it is running (if it is runnable). |
| `lock` | Lock the current set of modules. This will require a restart of Katana. |
| `--update` | This is a special argument for updating katana to the latest version from this repo. For development purposes, an optional second parameter to pull from a specific branch.  |

## Locking Katana
This feature is for instructors who are setting up a lab environment for students. Once all the desired tools and targets are installed for the lab, running `katana lock` will lock the web UI in place so that 
any modules that have not been installed will no longer be listed, and installed modules cannot be removed.

To remove the lock, remove the `katana.lock` file from the Katana installation folder (usually `/opt/katana/katana.lock`).

Changing the lock will require a restart of Katana. Note that the Katana web UI is itself a katana module, therefore `katana stop katana` followed by `katana start katana` will restart the web UI.

# Development

Katana is intended to be a framework so that SamuraiWTF can support a wide range of web targets for teaching application security lessons.
